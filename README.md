## General info
### From the beginning the project has assumptions to be made such as:
* DB should be random and logical (imitate real production)
* DB needs to be created automatically and easy to created 
* Django should connect to created DB and get informations from there
* Setup for project should be as easy as possible, with all necessary instrucitons
* for each of the modulus there will be instructions how to run it

### Project is separated into three major moduls;
* Using Python to create a logical DB(PostgreSQL) for project
* Using Django to display and handle interactions between DB and users
* Make it live using Heroku+AWS

## Login details
Login as admin:
* username - admin
* password - admin
